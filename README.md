## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](/docs/Data%20Warehouse%20Project.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

In this project, you:

1. **Design the architecture:** a modern data warehouse with three layers, bronze, silver and gold.
2. **Build the ETL pipelines:** load the source files and move the data through the layers.
3. **Model the data:** facts and dimensions, ready for reports.
4. **Analyze it:** answer business questions with SQL.
